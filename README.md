## Postit

This is a practice app to learn Ruby on Rails that I created while participating in Rapid Prototyping with Ruby on Rails with Tealeaf Academy.  The functional behavior is similar to Reddit.  Users can add posts, make comments and vote on the posts.  Some of the key aspects of Rails that I learned about from this app are:

- ActiveRecord Associations: 1:M, M:M and polymorphic
- RESTful routing
- MVC
- Slugging
- Validations
- Partials
- Ajax with Rails
- Deploying to Heroku
